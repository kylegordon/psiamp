Some code I wrote a long long time ago. I think the goal was to integrate a Psion 5MX over serial to computer running Winamp with some form of library backend and soundcard.

Not even sure the project worked, as I never got around to installing the head unit (it was supposed to be a touch screen interface to a car music system)
